# Water Tank Monitoring System

## Overview

The **Water Tank Monitoring System** is an embedded systems project designed to monitor and control water levels in a tank. This project utilizes a microcontroller to measure water levels using sensors and display the information on an LCD. The system can also trigger alerts or control water pumps based on the water level readings.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of water levels.
- Display of water levels on an LCD screen.
- Automated control of water pumps or alarms based on predefined thresholds.
- Data logging for historical analysis (optional).

## Hardware Requirements

- **Microcontroller:** Arduino (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- **Display:** 16x2 LCD
- **Sensors:** Water level sensors (e.g., ultrasonic sensor or float sensors)
- **Relay Module:** For controlling water pumps or alarms
- **Miscellaneous:** Breadboard, jumper wires, power supply

## Software Requirements

- **IDE:** Arduino IDE
- **Libraries:** LiquidCrystal library for LCD (and other sensor-specific libraries if needed)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdrlrahman-Mansour/Water-Tank.git
   cd Water-Tank
